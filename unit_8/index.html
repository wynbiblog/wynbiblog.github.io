				<h2>About</h2>
				The Social Network for the Professional Journey. Your professional journey is one of the most important adventures in life. It is filled with tough questions, and challenges that require real solutions. We believe that a great professional network should be much more than a business card holder, or place to keep track of meaningless connections. ...and it certainly should not be yet another place to receive spam from strangers. We think it's time for professional networking to have a fresh start. We created Wynbi to be the compass to help guide you on your journey to success. We created our features to help you answer all of the tough questions so that you will be able to make meaningful connections, stand out in the crowd, and ultimately land the job of your dreams.

				<h3>Don’t let your Resume Ruin your Chances</h3>
				<p>Avoid Typos and Grammatical Errors
					The smallest mistake can make you look sloppy.

					Note outcomes Instead of Duties
					Don't just list off task you performed, show your outcomes. 

					Nix the Irrelevant Work Experience 
					Get rid of work experience that is irrelevant. That job serving snow cones in high school won't help you get the marketing position you are applying for now. 

					Tailor Your Resume to the Position 
					Employers want to see a resume that is tailored to the specific position you are applying for.

					Use Action Verbs
					Switch out overused words with action verbs—below is a great resource.

					Too Creative 
					Don't let fonts and style distract from important experience. 

					Ditch Company Specific Jargon 
					Use terms that are the norm in a specific industry, not words or systems that are unique to your current company. </p>
