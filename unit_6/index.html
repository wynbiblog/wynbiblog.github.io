		The Social Network for the Professional Journey. Your professional journey is one of the most important adventures in life. It is filled with tough questions, and challenges that require real solutions. We believe that a great professional network should be much more than a business card holder, or place to keep track of meaningless connections. ...and it certainly should not be yet another place to receive spam from strangers. We think it's time for professional networking to have a fresh start. We created Wynbi to be the compass to help guide you on your journey to success. We created our features to help you answer all of the tough questions so that you will be able to make meaningful connections, stand out in the crowd, and ultimately land the job of your dreams.
